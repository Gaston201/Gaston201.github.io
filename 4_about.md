This website is being developed by me Gaston, a student at Linnaeus University with the subject
"Utveckling och drift av mjukvarusystem", you can find more information about the course
<a href="https://lnu.se/program/ngudm/20162/61016/">here</a>.

On top of that, I'm 20 years old and located close to Uppsala. Currently my interests include being on my computer
and so on.

If you have any questions you can reach me at this email address: <a>gb222fv@student.lnu.se</a>
